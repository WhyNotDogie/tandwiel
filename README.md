# tandwiel
> CABIN-inspired minecraft modpack focused on challenging automation progression and space exploration.

**Tandwiel** is a modpack that will challenge you with difficult progression focused on automation with the power of *Create*, and exploring space with using *Ad Astra*, with other refreshing and difficult mods to spice up progression such as *Hex Casting*, *Create: The Factory Must Grow (TFMG)*, *Create: Metallurgy*, and many more. Unlike the modpack that inspired it, Tandwiel does not stop at the moon. In fact, it allows you to explore **all** of the Ad Astra planets, allowing you to start exploring when you reach the **third** automation tier, with more tiers afterwards for better rockets!
